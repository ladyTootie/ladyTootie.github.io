## Project description

For my final project in Surver of Scripting Languages, I chose to check for compliance on a Windows OS using STIG. Since my major is Cybersecurity, I figured this would be good practice. I used PowerShell to write my script, and I checked for five of the STIG compliances on a Windows machine. One of the biggest learning curves of this project was figuring out the commands to check for compliance. Depending on what you are checking, the syntax for the command will vary. This project gave me insight on how useful writing scripts for automation is. 

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
